1.read a .cap file
	-The program can parse rules in a natural language.
	filter by ip
	filter by protocol(TCP,UDP,ICMP code)
2.based on filter logic, example, ip , protocol, etc, add a new list of packets to a new
pcap file

3.make python file an exe that can parse arguments? maybe not,
without exe: filter.py -t arg1 -s arg2
with exe: filter -t arg1 -s arg2 (plus user doesnt need to have installed python for app to work)

-procedural natural input

	-user choose outbound or inbound rule(if outbound filter out all src-ip == local-ip)
	(if inbound filter all dest-ip == local-ip)
	-ask user to put name of rule(optional, if each rule has an id)
	-store rules in a text file, app will read text file to execute either on pcap or         network
	-request user location of capture
	(store capture in a list)

TODO mac address filtering is not possible with PYdivert, for now...

TODO plug python app into windows os withotu the need to install python or packages on target machine
